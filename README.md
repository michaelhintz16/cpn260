This is the nav bar assignemnt
i created a responsive nav bar that when it gets smaller it changes to the hamburger menue but it does not actualy do anything 

this time i validated my code a little beter there is still some code thats not validated but thats because if i was to change it or anything it will mess up the website 
it took me some time to do this but i found out that page structure and of course validating your coede is way more important then i thought.
